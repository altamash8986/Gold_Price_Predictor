#  Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a **Linear Regression** model to predict the **price of gold** based on historical features like `Open`, `High`, `Low`, and `Volume`. The app includes a **Gradio-powered web interface**, which makes it easy to test predictions interactively.

> **Built with  Scikit-learn + Gradio**  
> **Visualized using Matplotlib**
